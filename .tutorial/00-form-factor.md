# Tutorial on Making Replit Tutorials

This is a helper guide on making replit tutorials for your workshops. See the next slide for the overall gist of how to do it, and the later slides for a bunch more indepth info I've picked up after doing a bunch of these over the last few months.


## Overall Takeaway: Leverage Replit's Form Factor for Teaching

Replit as a nix-based in-browser IDE means you have reproducible, deterministic builds for your tutorial/workshop's programming environment. If you can run it, so can the students, even if they're using Windows machines or on mobile! Take advantage of the fact that they will definitely be able to code along with you!!!

Get the student to:

1. Run starter code FIRST and see it error
2. Explain the error and what the student will need to do to get it to pass
3. Give the student the information required to get to the next step
4. Have a test or command the student can run which will confirm they've completed this step

Again, for this form factor you should ALWAYS start a section by having the student DO SOMETHING, not have to read or learn something first. Have them fail, read why the failed and learn how to fix it, then fix it and run a command that passes.
